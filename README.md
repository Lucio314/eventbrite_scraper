        "description": "Before you had employees, all you had to do was to make sure you are a high performer yourself. You know why you wanted to get up early in the morning, fight traffic, and get to work. You now have employees. How do you get other people to want to produce high performance? How do get others to be as eager as you are? Everyone is \"uniquely different \", with their own set of reasons , their own set of whys : 200 people on the same airplane flying from Los Angeles to New York, they are going from Los Angeles to New York for 200 different reasons! Person A is going to New York for business ; Person B came to Los Angeles from New York for vacation and is now returning home; Person C is on his way from Los Angeles to London to visit his family and will be changing flight in New York; You are going to New York for your own reasons. The other 199 passengers are also going to New York, but they are going for their own reasons. Same trip, same destination, different reasons. You can't project your reasons and your whys that motivate yourself onto your employees! Do you know what drives each and every one of your employees? What is their personal long, mid and short term goals ? Do you know their individual reasons why they get up early in the morning, fight traffic, and get to work? How do you go about finding out what is the individual unique \"What's In It For Me?\" for each and every one of your employee? How do you create the feeling deep down inside each and every one of your employees that you are approachable - so your employees would feel safe to volunteer to tell you what you need to know? Why you need to \" inspire \" them instead of \" motivate \" them, and how ? And how do you utilize their own individual unique set of \"What's In It For Me\", to get them to want to give you high performance? Do you understand the difference between \"job security mindset\" vs \"career security mindset\"? Do you understand employee's view on \"income\" vs \" meaning \"? Why you must think beyond money as the motivator? What are some of the reasons , drivers , motivators , that are not money? that can work more effectively than money to motivate your  employees? How do you figure out what are some of the \"beyond money\" reasons, drivers and motivators, for each and every one of your employees? We will use what motivate consumers to spend money as examples to illustrate our teaching point, and equip you with the ability to figure out reasons other than money so you can use to motivate/ inspire your employees for excellent performance. You should attend if you are: A manager or a business owner, Managing a team of employees, Or managing a team of managers. In just 1 hour, you will learn the skill to get your employees to Want to do what you Need them to do. This class is \"On-Demand\". As soon as you register, you will be able to attend the class. There is no need to wait. Comments from past students: \"I was frustrated when I couldn't get my employees to be as eager as me. After taking this class, I realized: I was trying to project my reasons and my whys onto my employees LOL other people are not me and they have their own reasons and their whys!\" \"I could not get my employees to tell me what they wanted until I took this class. In this great class, I learned how to set it up so people will always want to volunteer to tell me what I needed to know - I had no idea how easy it can be if you know the right method and my old method was hard work and counterproductive !\" \"Should've taken this class with Coach Michael Lin 5 years ago when I first had employees. I wish I learned all these secret insights 5 years ago! Don't make my mistake - you need to take this class ASAP!\" Leadership Secrets Series Webinars (OnDemand & EverGreen): 1: Delegation Skills for Busy Leaders - Why & How 2: How To Motivate & Inspire Your Employees?

Q: Why does \"Traditional Management Training\" no longer work when you need to turn your managers into today's leaders? A: Traditional Management Training focuses on the \" what \": \"what needs to be done\" & \"what are the processes to get things done\". Traditional Management Training does not teach today's leaders the \" How \". \" How to get your human employees to want to do what you need them to do.\" Traditional Management Training either ignores all the human factors, or treats humans like objects , for example: obedient robots. Coach Michael Lin is known for the effectiveness of his leadership teaching. He utilizes seminars, workshops and one-on-one coaching to turn your managers into real effective leaders! His leadership seminar students love his unique teaching content , as well as his unique teaching method . He is the best, at: ● Discovering what is in people's blindspot that is holding them back, causing internal conflicts deep down inside; ● Effectively teaching his students new ways of understanding their situations, therefore helping them to resolve the conflicts in their thinking, so they can become more productive - instantly! +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ The \" Effectiveness \" of a seminar, is: Not measured by \"Posh Production\"; Not measured by \"Flashy & Pretty Seminar Presenter\"; But measured by \"What new skills do students learn\". +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ Q: Too often, a Keynote is delivered as a memorized script, a well rehearsed act, with overly exaggerated body movements and voice inflections, completely memorized down to the tiniest move of the finger, smallest change in the tone of voice and even the exact duration of each pause, which makes it acting not teaching . Should a Keynote be an actor acting? Or a teacher teaching? A: People come to hear a Keynote, to learn something! If they wanted to see a well rehearsed act for their entertainment, they'd go to a concert or a theatre! Recall the best teachers you've ever had, they were teachers teaching not actors acting! Imagine schools replaced \"math teachers\" with \"math actors\" for your kids! Parents will NOT accept that! So don't act, teach! Sure, make the teaching inspirational not painful, but teach don't act! Q: Upon completion of the speech, should the Keynote presenter leave and disappear? A: Absolutely NOT!!! The attendees have questions! Questions about business leadership that are not only holding them back, but also: they only feel comfortable asking in private but never in public :-( And it's by answering these types of questions, after the presentation, at the back of the room, outside in the hallway... that the presenter makes the greatest positive impact to your organization! +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ To book Leadership Seminars, Workshops & Keynotes, for your company training and or industry event, so your people will truly learn new skills that are useful to them, simply send an email to: CoachMichaelLin@Gmail.com +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ BIO: Coach Michael Lin came out of the tech industry, and uses his superb analytical skills to dissect business challenges. He has deep insights into human nature, which he uses to help people to solve their business challenges. His analysis and solutions are all based on Emotional Intelligence , not on how we wish humans ought to be, but based on what humans actually are. Managers & Leaders from over 500 organizations across many industries have attended seminars and workshops taught by Coach Michael Lin.

Key Takeaways from his leadership seminars and workshops: 1: What makes other people tick ? Employees who report to us? Our peer managers & leaders? Outside customers? Outside vendors? Shareholders? Upper management? 2: How to identify the right incentives - for other people? Why should we not confuse “the right incentive for ourselves\" with \"the right incentive for others”? How to utilize our insights into short term vs long term pain & pleasure to influence, persuade and help others, to create Win/Win outcomes for everyone? 3: How to advance our own careers, by going out of our way to: help others?! solve other people's problems ?! Why do we need to understand the big picture of the corporation (not just \"my department\") and solve problems for the entire corporation? 4: \"Software Upgrade\" in our heads, from employee thinking (my hours for my salary), into business thinking : what do customers need and want? how to provide goods/services for customers? What hardware & human capabilities do we have? how to inspire employees to want to give their best - using non monetary incentives ? How to create win/win for everyone? customers, shareholders, employees, and managers/leaders? 5: Why Confidence Building by practicing Fear Busting is the key to Self Development ? How can we constantly expand our comfort zone, by doing things we know we should do, but don't do - due to fear? +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ Interview/Article on Coaching & Leadership: Here is an Interview/Article by Coach Michael Lin on \" Moving From Command & Control to Coaching & Collaboration: How Leaders and Managers Can Become Better Coaches - the Why, the What, and the How\" : https://medium.com/authority-magazine/moving-from-command-control-to-coaching-collaboration-michael-lin-on-how-leaders-and-managers-64fdf22eaa71 +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ Comments from attendees: Here is a list of two dozen people telling us what they thought of the teaching , after they've attended the seminar or workshop by Coach Michael Lin: (These people range from brand new managers to highly experienced leaders, from various private sectors to the government...) https://youtu.be/_jPxflr1LV8 +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ Sample Teaching Session: Here is a short sample of Coach Michael Lin in action, helping managers to get over their fears and grow into Real Leaders , so they can do what they are afraid of doing but need to be doing: https://youtu.be/Wc4GylRBQ6U +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ Coach Michael Lin In The Media: Here are over a dozen media interviews , in which Coach Michael Lin answers tough questions from journalists on leadership: Are you an \" enabler \" without realizing it? Are you unintentionally attracting bad job applicants? Are you helping or are you harming Millennials and GenZers? How managers can advance their own careers in leadership by obtaining coaching skills? How to be socially responsible when it comes to hiring? How to create bonding and hence loyalty from your employees to yourself that will last a lifetime? How to unite your team? What are some of the biggest redflags you need to watchout for? What are some of the key beliefs about leadership that are holding older managers back?? What is the responsible thing to do with people who refuse to accept \"personal responsibility \"?

Today's seminar has been the best , and I have attended a lot of seminars, I mean a lot. \" \"You know, attending a seminar can be hit or miss. Today's seminar was definitely a hit .\" \"My colleagues at work just texted me and asked me if I am bored being stuck in a seminar. I texted them back telling them: 'Surprisingly not, even though I was expecting it to be just another boring waste of time seminar. I am actually learning a lot of useful information and the learning process is actually fun !' I also told my colleagues back in the office: 'You guys should all be here! having fun and learning useful info at the same time!' \" +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ We have all attended those waste of time seminars that are: Boring; Lacking useful content; Not able to solve any problems - problems that were the reason why training was organized to address and resolve; Refusing or not able to answer questions from attendees; Spent all day lecturing the attendees on \"What to accomplish\" & \"What ability you must have\"; But never taught the attendees \"How to accomplish what they need to accomplish\"; and never taught any of the skills the attendees are supposed to \"must have\"; The entire so-called \"training\" was designed \"For Show\" and or \"For Formality\": just going through the Bureaucratic Motions so everyone can say: \"see, we conducted training\". Why bring another one of those waste of time seminars to your company? And force employees to endure the ordeal? Be a real hero , bring a seminar that your employees will: Actually learn useful info that they've been craving for, for the info can help them to solve their real life problems! Enjoy the learning process, for the learning process is inspirational not painful; Thank you and think of you as their BIG hero! And when leaders improve? everyone in the company gets to enjoy the benefit: from team members to shareholders! And all of them will be thanking you for organizing training that's useful!
