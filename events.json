Die simple, aber sehr kraftvolle Technik ermöglicht es, in unterbewusste und bewusstseinsverändernde Zustände zu gelangen. Schließe deine Augen, richte deine Aufmerksamkeit auf deinen Atem - Fülle den Bauch, die Brust und lass den Atem wieder fallen. Komme in einen kontinuierlichen Fluss, ganz in deinem Rhythmus und verbinde dich mit dir selbst - So beginnt die Reise beim Conscious Connected Breathing. Eine tiefgehende Atemreise und eine gesunde Männerrunde - Dies erwartet Dich beim Breathwork von Vital Breath. Wir öffnen einen Raum, in dem Du in Verbindung mit deinem Körper kommst und ganz Du selbst sein kannst. In unserem Alltag, wo wir immer von einem zum anderen springen, unseren Gedanken kaum Ruhe gönnen und immer mehr Leistung von uns erwartet wird, ist es wichtig, immer wieder zu sich zu kommen, nach Innen zu spüren und in Verbindung zu kommen. Angeleitet durch Patrick und Paul, lässt Du dich in die meditative Session begleiten. Die Technik ermöglicht es, tiefe persönliche Ebenen an Emotionen, alten Geschichten, psychische oder energetische Blockaden wahrzunehmen und aufzuarbeiten. Üblich sind auch tiefe Zustände der Entspannung sowie der Wahrnehmungsverzerrung von Raum und Zeit. Aber keine Sorge, es kommen alle wieder zurück. Durch die Erfahrung in der Männerarbeit wissen wir, was für eine inspirierende und transformative Energie im Kreis von Männern aufkommen kann. Dies im Verbund mit der Atemarbeit gibt uns Männer noch einmal neue Möglichkeiten für Prozessarbeit und uns besser und anders kennenzulernen. Wir arbeiten nach der Naikando Methode - Vibrationen verschiedener Art benutzen wir als Tools, um die Session zu leiten. Musik bildet die Grundlage und gibt Dir einen Rhythmus vor. Mit Stimmgabel, verschiedenen Klanginstrumenten und der Stimme können wir spezifisch Impulse geben und jeden individuell in seinem Prozess begleiten und unterstützen. Essenzielle Infos: Du brauchst keine Vorerfahrung, um an der Session teilzunehmen. Trage bequeme Kleidung, in der du dich wohl fühlst Vermeide schwere Kost zwei Stunden vor dem Breathwork Lies dir bitte die kontraindikationen auf unserer Webseite durch Mehr Infos unter: maennerkreis-jedermann.ch/breathwork Wir freuen uns auf Dich bei Vital Breath im Be:Life"},

Yes, you read that right. Out of this, a substantial US$36 billion came from Corporations, US$103 billion from Foundations and a whopping US$374 billion from individual donors with the remainder from bequests. With over half of Americans actively participating in charitable giving, the reasons behind their generosity are as multifaceted as the donors themselves.Be it alumni upholding devotion to their alma mater, a US Foundation fostering innovation with exciting programs, or major donors with Swiss ancestry or interests, the diversity of American donors is as vast as the organisations they support. With our 27 years of experience in the American market, we possess an intimate understanding of its nuances and want to leverage this knowledge for your benefit to help you tap into this multi billion dollar funding pool. We would like to invite you to our in-person, one-day, practical and targeted workshop, \"Fundraising from America.\" This exclusive event, scheduled for 29th October 2024 at the Centre International de Conférences Geneve (CICG)in Geneva, has been meticulously curated to give you practical information about tax and legal issues, fundraising information and the information you need to know to maximise your potential in the American market. Led by international experts Nancy Bikson (International tax lawyer),Lior Renous and Arnaud Marcilhacy (French fundraiser) you will benefit from over 50 years collective experience in global giving. Morning session - we will focus on American fundraising generally including the legal and tax issues you need to know and how to address them and will look at the issues relating to fundraising from Major Donors and Companies . We will discuss prospect research, wealth screening and relationship mapping as well as building a US-orientated Case for Support and Action Plan. And we will talk about how to cultivate and steward donors without being physically present in the US all the time. Afternoon session - we will demystify Fundraising from Foundations . Learn to navigate the labyrinth of foundation funding, from identifying funders and opportunities that align with your mission to engagement strategies for optimising your success. We offer tools and knowledge to craft compelling grant applications that captivate decision-makers and secure essential funding.

Today, meaningful connection is more important than ever. Research consistently shows that the quality of our relationships is the most significant factor in our overall happiness and health. Yet, many of us feel that our connections aren’t as deep or authentic as we’d like them to be. This workshop offers a unique opportunity to discover the science and practice of authentic connection through a blend of somatic movement, Emotional Intelligence, and creative expression. This day-long workshop integrates **Azul Conscious Dance**, somatic and reflective practices to help you connect more deeply with yourself and others. Y ou’ll learn to sense, on a visceral level, what true connection feels like and how to create it in the moment. Why Connection Matters: Connection isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s a fundamental human need. Here’s what research tells us: 1. Vital for Health and Longevity: Studies from the Harvard Study of Adult Development show that strong relationships are the most significant predictor of long-term health and happiness. 2. Reduces Stress and Enhances Resilience: Research indicates that close connections can lower stress levels and help us cope with life’s challenges more effectively. 3. Supports Emotional Well-being:** Our connections shape our sense of self-worth, belonging, and emotional stability. 4. Enhances Cognitive Function: Engaging in meaningful relationships has been shown to improve brain function and reduce cognitive decline as we age. 5. Fosters Personal Growth: Authentic connections provide a safe space for vulnerability, growth, and self-discovery. What You Will Experience: - Morning Session: - Opening Circle: Set intentions and create a welcoming space for exploration. - Azul Conscious Dance: Engage in mindful movement that deepens self-awareness, presence and self-intimacy. - Insights on Connection: Discover how your nervous system influences your ability to connect, with references to polyvagal theory and attachment styles. - Reflective Practices: Drawing and journaling to help integrate your experiences. - Lunch Break: A chance to pause, connect, and reflect. - Afternoon Session: - Partner Exercises: Simple practices that emphasize trust, empathy, and authentic communication. - Group Movement: Explore the dynamics of connection within a community, understanding how we relate in collective settings. - Emotional Intelligence Tools: Gain insights into how to navigate emotions and enhance communication. - Creative Reflection: Further integrate the day’s learnings through creative expression and sharing. - Integration and Closing Circle: Reflect on your experiences and insights. Throughout the day, participants will explore how the way we move reflects the way we live, using the body as a guide to uncover deeper truths and foster a sense of unity and belonging. This journey provides a safe space for being yourself and expressing your true nature, where all interactions and connections are facilitated within a guided framework and with full consent. The practices are designed to delve deeply into subconscious layers , allowing participants to identify and reflect on images, thoughts, beliefs, fears, and emotions. Participants will sense through the nervous system and body, gaining clarity on what deeper connection feels like. What You’ll Gain: This workshop offers an experience grounded in both research and embodied practice. You’ll leave with: - A Deep Sense of Connection: Experience the feeling of true connection in your body through movement and presence. - Practical Insights : Learn simple, effective practices to enhance your emotional intelligence and communication skills. - Greater Self-Awareness : Explore how your body and emotions interact, helping you navigate relationships with more clarity and confidence. - Joy, Fun, Creativity and Flow : Enjoy a day filled with joy, positive connections, creative expression, a sense of flow and discovery. \"The way we move is the way we live, and through mindful movement, we can rediscover our authentic selves.\" — Thomas Hanna \"Movement connects us to the present moment, to ourselves, and to the world around us, fostering a sense of unity and belonging.\" — Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen \"Through somatic awareness, we can decode the messages of our nervous system and re-pattern our connections to self and others.\" — Dr. Pat Ogden Join us on a journey towards greater self-awareness, connection, and joy!

Über bewusstes, fokussiertes Atmen wird das eigene Energiefeld so weit aufgebaut, dass sich ein erweiterter, transzendentaler Bewusstseinszustand erreichen lässt. In diesem Zustand können sowohl eigene Potenziale erkannt als auch unterdrückte Erlebnisse, Gefühle und Emotionen bewusst gemacht und zusammen mit den zugehörigen Programmen integriert oder aufgelöst werden. Am Freitag den 15.11.2024 Einlass ab 19:30 Uhr, Beginn um 19:45 Uhr. Nach Beginn der Veranstaltung ist kein Einlass mehr möglich. Dauer der Atem-Session ca. 80 min. VVOO YOGA STUDIO, Dufourstrasse 90, oberhalb Monocle, 8008 Zürich Seefeld Mehr Infos: Der RESET Conscious Breathwork-Abend ist ein seit vielen Jahren etabliertes Atemtherapie-Format, bei dem sich intensive Trance-Atmung mit moderner Energiemedizin, sensibler Körperarbeit und Geistigem Heilen verbindet. Das Balancieren von Geist, Seele und Körper fördert die Selbstheilungskräfte und unterstützt bei der Wiederentdeckung der eignen Fähigkeiten und Möglichkeiten. Durch die geführte Atem-Meditation, die aufmerksame Begleitung des erfahrenen Teams und das Kohärenz Feld der gemeinsam atmenden Gruppe entsteht ein sicherer Raum, der Dir die Möglichkeit gibt Dich und Deine Themen zu explorieren. Die Begleiter des RESET Conscious Breathwork-Abends sind ausgebildete Therapeuten, die während der Atmungen für Dich da sind, für einen geschützten Raum sorgen und sowohl in der Atmung, als auch darüber hinaus für Integrationsarbeit und Nachbereitung zur Verfügung stehen. Hier ein paar Hinweise, damit du dich rundum wohlfühlst: Trage bequeme Kleidung, in der du dich gut bewegen kannst. Iss lieber nur eine leichte Mahlzeit vorher. Verzichte auf starkes Parfüm, damit wir alle frei atmen können. Alkohol am besten vor der Session meiden. Wenn du dich nicht fit fühlst, gönn dir bitte Ruhe zu Hause. https://danhart.co/reset/"},

HATHA YOGA The term \"hatha\" combines the Sanskrit roots \"ha\" (sun) and \"tha\" (moon), symbolizing the twin energy forces,which exist in everything and are balanced through the practice of Hatha Yoga. A typical Hatha Yoga class involves slower-paced movements, with an emphasis on holding asanas (postures) for extended periods and integrating controlled breathing. This practice is suitable for those seeking a mindful, holistic, grounding yoga experience and wanting to achieve mental clarity, a healthy body, and a sense of peace. MANTRA Mantra is a sound, and sound is an aspect of energy, a powerful energy which can influence the mind. A mantra is a powerful sound vibration, rooted in the Sanskrit words for \"repetition\" and \"freedom,\" that influences the mind and consciousness. Mantras help practitioners concentrate, calm emotions, purify impressions, and invite positive energy by affecting the deeper layers of the mind and consciousness."},

Join Sylvie Horvath of Soul Dimension for a transformative 90-minute Breathwork meditation journey designed to awaken what Yogis call Kundalini - the super potent, intelligent life force energy within. During this class, you'll be guided on an expansive journey of self-discovery and transformation. You'll experience how Soul Dimension breathing and simple ancient yogic practices can activate your body’s natural healing energy, deep reservoirs of vitality, clarity, bliss states, and expanded consciousness. When the Kundalini energy awakens, it stimulates your body’s natural healing mechanisms, promoting physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. This energy also unlocks greater creative flows, removes stuck and stagnant energy, promotes equilibrium, and awakens your deeper potential in all areas of life. What is Kundalini Energy? Kundalini energy is often described as a latent life force that resides at the base of the spine, symbolized as a coiled serpent. In scientific terms, it’s closely associated with the nervous system and bioenergy—the energy that flows through our bodies and sustains life. When this energy is activated through practices like breathwork, meditation, or yoga, it is directed up the spine through chakras (energy centers), enhancing physical, emotional, and spiritual health. Kundalini awakening happens when this powerful, dormant energy begins to rise up through the spine, passing through the chakras, activating, balancing, and purifying them. This process leads to a profound holistic transformation that affects every dimension of a person's being - physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. Yogis believe that when kundalini awakens, one's true life begins. Who is This Class For? Perfect for both beginners and experienced practitioners, this session is designed to support a safe, nurturing, and expansive experience on your journey of self-discovery, healing, and awakening to your highest potential. Benefits of Awakening Kundalini Spiritual Awakening: Many masters of Kundalini yoga describe Kundalini awakening as a profound journey toward enlightenment, offering deeper insights into the nature of existence and the self. Expanded Consciousness: Spiritual teachers emphasize that Kundalini's awakening broadens awareness, connecting individuals to higher states of consciousness and universal wisdom. Union with the Divine: According to Kundalini masters, this energy leads to a sense of oneness with the divine, promoting a sacred connection with the cosmos or universal life force. Heightened Intuition: Awakening Kundalini is said to sharpen intuition, allowing individuals to access deeper levels of inner guidance and spiritual perception. Cleansing of Karma: Spiritual teachings highlight that Kundalini purifies karmic imprints, helping to clear past life blockages and accelerate spiritual evolution. Balancing Chakras: Kundalini energy is believed to harmonize and activate the chakras, aligning the body's energetic centers and promoting overall balance. Inner Wisdom and Knowledge: Many masters teach that Kundalini activates dormant wisdom within, helping one access ancient knowledge and spiritual truths. Inner Joy and Bliss: Once awakened, Kundalini often brings a state of bliss or Ananda, described by teachers as an innate, unshakeable joy that transcends external circumstances. Deep Healing: Spiritual guides often note that Kundalini energy supports profound emotional, mental, and physical healing, as it clears blockages and aligns one’s energy with higher vibrations. Divine Transformation: Masters describe Kundalini as a catalyst for deep transformation, helping individuals evolve into their highest self and live a life of purpose, service, and divine connection. Symptoms of Kundalini Energy Awakening? Sudden Surges of Energy: Feeling waves of heat or tingling sensations moving up the spine or throughout the body. Heightened Awareness: Becoming more attuned to subtle energies, sounds, and sensations around you. Spontaneous Emotional Release: Experiencing sudden bursts of emotion, such as crying or laughter, is often related to emotional healing. Increased Creativity: A surge of creative ideas, artistic inspiration, or desire to create. Changes in Sleep Patterns: Difficulty sleeping or needing less sleep as the body adjusts to new energy levels. Vivid Dreams or Visions: Having intense, symbolic dreams or even visions during meditation. Physical Sensations: Feeling pressure or sensations in the head (often at the crown), base of the spine, or along the spinal column. Intense Focus or Mental Clarity: A deepening sense of clarity and concentration, allowing you to focus on complex ideas or spiritual insights. Heightened Intuition: A stronger inner voice, clearer gut feelings, or enhanced psychic abilities. Temporary Physical Discomfort: Some experience tension, muscle spasms, or other temporary discomforts as the body adjusts to the energy shift. Changes in Appetite or Diet: Sudden shifts in food preferences, often leaning towards lighter, cleaner foods as energy realigns. These symptoms can vary in intensity and duration, depending on the person and how prepared their body and mind are for the awakening process. Though powerful, Kundalini's awakening is most beneficial when approached with patience and a focus on grounding the energy for balance and integration.

Join Sylvie Horvath of Soul Dimension for a transformative 90-minute Breathwork meditation journey designed to awaken what Yogis call Kundalini - the super potent, intelligent life force energy within. During this class, you'll be guided on an expansive journey of self-discovery and transformation. You'll experience how Soul Dimension breathing and simple ancient yogic practices can activate your body’s natural healing energy, deep reservoirs of vitality, clarity, bliss states, and expanded consciousness. When the Kundalini energy awakens, it stimulates your body’s natural healing mechanisms, promoting physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. This energy also unlocks greater creative flows, removes stuck and stagnant energy, promotes equilibrium, and awakens your deeper potential in all areas of life. What is Kundalini Energy? Kundalini energy is often described as a latent life force that resides at the base of the spine, symbolized as a coiled serpent. In scientific terms, it’s closely associated with the nervous system and bioenergy—the energy that flows through our bodies and sustains life. When this energy is activated through practices like breathwork, meditation, or yoga, it is directed up the spine through chakras (energy centers), enhancing physical, emotional, and spiritual health. Kundalini awakening happens when this powerful, dormant energy begins to rise up through the spine, passing through the chakras, activating, balancing, and purifying them. This process leads to a profound holistic transformation that affects every dimension of a person's being - physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. Yogis believe that when kundalini awakens, one's true life begins. Who is This Class For? Perfect for both beginners and experienced practitioners, this session is designed to support a safe, nurturing, and expansive experience on your journey of self-discovery, healing, and awakening to your highest potential. Benefits of Awakening Kundalini Spiritual Awakening: Many masters of Kundalini yoga describe Kundalini awakening as a profound journey toward enlightenment, offering deeper insights into the nature of existence and the self. Expanded Consciousness: Spiritual teachers emphasize that Kundalini's awakening broadens awareness, connecting individuals to higher states of consciousness and universal wisdom. Union with the Divine: According to Kundalini masters, this energy leads to a sense of oneness with the divine, promoting a sacred connection with the cosmos or universal life force. Heightened Intuition: Awakening Kundalini is said to sharpen intuition, allowing individuals to access deeper levels of inner guidance and spiritual perception. Cleansing of Karma: Spiritual teachings highlight that Kundalini purifies karmic imprints, helping to clear past life blockages and accelerate spiritual evolution. Balancing Chakras: Kundalini energy is believed to harmonize and activate the chakras, aligning the body's energetic centers and promoting overall balance. Inner Wisdom and Knowledge: Many masters teach that Kundalini activates dormant wisdom within, helping one access ancient knowledge and spiritual truths. Inner Joy and Bliss: Once awakened, Kundalini often brings a state of bliss or Ananda, described by teachers as an innate, unshakeable joy that transcends external circumstances. Deep Healing: Spiritual guides often note that Kundalini energy supports profound emotional, mental, and physical healing, as it clears blockages and aligns one’s energy with higher vibrations. Divine Transformation: Masters describe Kundalini as a catalyst for deep transformation, helping individuals evolve into their highest self and live a life of purpose, service, and divine connection. Symptoms of Kundalini Energy Awakening? Sudden Surges of Energy: Feeling waves of heat or tingling sensations moving up the spine or throughout the body. Heightened Awareness: Becoming more attuned to subtle energies, sounds, and sensations around you. Spontaneous Emotional Release: Experiencing sudden bursts of emotion, such as crying or laughter, is often related to emotional healing. Increased Creativity: A surge of creative ideas, artistic inspiration, or desire to create. Changes in Sleep Patterns: Difficulty sleeping or needing less sleep as the body adjusts to new energy levels. Vivid Dreams or Visions: Having intense, symbolic dreams or even visions during meditation. Physical Sensations: Feeling pressure or sensations in the head (often at the crown), base of the spine, or along the spinal column. Intense Focus or Mental Clarity: A deepening sense of clarity and concentration, allowing you to focus on complex ideas or spiritual insights. Heightened Intuition: A stronger inner voice, clearer gut feelings, or enhanced psychic abilities. Temporary Physical Discomfort: Some experience tension, muscle spasms, or other temporary discomforts as the body adjusts to the energy shift. Changes in Appetite or Diet: Sudden shifts in food preferences, often leaning towards lighter, cleaner foods as energy realigns. These symptoms can vary in intensity and duration, depending on the person and how prepared their body and mind are for the awakening process. Though powerful, Kundalini's awakening is most beneficial when approached with patience and a focus on grounding the energy for balance and integration.

You will find out: Why TM is so effective for stress and anxiety Why anyone can practise TM What benefits you can realistically expect How it works – the process of transcending How TM differs from other meditations What happens during TM Following the talk there will be an opportunity to meet privately with the teacher to discuss personal considerations. The talk is a prerequisite to joining one of the monthly scheduled courses of instruction in TM, but there is no commitment to learn. It is open to everyone even if you only have a mild curiosity! Feel free to bring a friend. Feel free to contact Philippe for any further questions you may have : phmercanton@mt-geneve.ch / 022 733 31 42 - 078 654 81 07. Looking forward seeing you on one of these occasions! Philippe Mercanton , certified TM-Teacher Route : tram 14,18; bus 3, 11 (bus stand : Servette)"},

Date: Do  31. Oktober 2024 Zeit: 19:00 Ort: UniS Kommen Sie zu einer faszinierenden Veranstaltung, bei der die Themen Evolution und Schöpfung aus verschiedenen Blickwinkeln beleuchtet werden. Ganz gleich, ob Sie sich für Naturwissenschaften oder für philosophische Diskussionen interessieren, dieser Diskussionsabend wird mit Sicherheit zu anregenden Gesprächen führen. Kommen Sie rechtzeitig, damit Sie noch einen guten Platz erwischen! Im nunmehr sechsten Vortrag der Reihe « Mehr als Sternenstaub?» geht es um die grundlegende Frage, ob die Vorstellung einer Schöpfung der Welt und die wissenschaftliche Evolutionstheorie im Widerspruch zueinanderstehen müssen. Kann man die beiden Perspektiven auch zusammen sehen? Wenn ja, wie? Oder was steht dem im Wege? Dazu diskutieren Vertreter der Biologie und der Theologie der Universität Bern. Schon im Vortrag von John Hedley Brooke vor rund einem Jahr kam diese Frage auf, als es um Charles Darwins Religionsverständnis ging. Der Vater der Evolutionstheorie, der zu Beginn seiner Karriere anglikanische Theologie studiert hatte, im Verlaufe seines Lebens sich aber vom Christentum distanziere, hielt die Idee eines Schöpfers für möglich. Während die letzten 6 Veranstaltungen hauptsächlich aus Vorträgen bestanden haben (gefolgt von einer moderierten Diskussion und einem Teil, in dem das Publikum Fragen stellen konnten), besteht die kommende Veranstaltung aus einer Diskussionsrunde mit Vertretern der Naturwissenschaften und der Theologie: Claudia Bank ist Professorin am Institut für Ökologie und Evolution der Universität Bern Sebastian Leidel ist Professor am Departement für Chemie, Biochemie und Pharmazeutische Wissenschaften der Universität Bern. Ursprünglich hatte er auch Theologie studiert- Andreas Losch , Theologe der Schweizerischen Bibelgesellschaft, hat sich auf das Gespräch mit den Naturwissenschaften spezialisiert. Er ist Privatdozent an der Uni Zürich und forscht zur «Ethik der Planetaren Nachhaltigkeit» an der Universität Bern. Moderiert wird der Abend von der reformierten Theologin Judith Wipfler , die seit 2000 als Fachredaktorin für Religion bei SRF arbeitet."},

The Contest serves as a platform for minority artists human rights defenders , who work on a variety of themes relating to minority rights and human rights. Organized with the support of the Centre des Arts of the International School of Geneva, the third edition of the Contest focuses on the theme of Minorities and Memory in the Present . During the Award Ceremony of 26 November, the laureates of the Third Edition of the Contest will be celebrated. Coming from different countries and contexts, the artists honored at this Ceremony are all distinguished by their artistic commitment, and their deeply personal interpretation of both intimate and collective experiences as members of national, linguistic, religious or ethnic minorities. In countries where minorities have been confronted with a history of human rights violations, the artistic and creative work of memorialization is crucial to advancing reparation, reconciliation and transitional justice. The artists honored at this Ceremony all shed light, each in their own way, on how the recognition of the past and memory are inexorably linked to the realization of human rights in the present and the future. Agenda : 19h00-20h00: Ceremony - presentation of Awards and Honorable Mentions to the laureates of the 2024 edition of the Contest 20h00-21h00: Cocktail reception The Ceremony will be held in English, with simultaneous translation into French available .
